# st-polynomial

Programs used for research into the st-polynomial, a 2-variable generalization of the Alexander polynomial of a link. Includes:

- flype.sage: contains function for returning the flyped version of a link, given a specified tangle. Currently quite rudimentary, restricted by arc labeling in link diagram and orientation of edges into the tangle.
- st.sage: contains functions for computing the st-polynomial of a link using both the matrix method and spanning tree method. Can also find the Tait graphs of a given link. 
- poly.sage: contains functions for plotting the Newton polytopes of link polynomials.
